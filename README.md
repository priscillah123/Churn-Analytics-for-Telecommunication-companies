A telecom company (Vodafone) wants to find out the likelihood of a customer leaving the company. This project aims to build a classification model that predicts if a customer will churn or not.

## Project Overview

In this project, we use Supervised Machine Learning (classification) Machine Learning to explore the significance of churn analytics as a strategic tool for telecommunication companies to proactively identify potential risk factors for churn, optimize retention efforts, and cultivate lasting customer relationships. The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to explore and analyze customer churn within the Vodafone network service.

The churn analytics predictive model is a data-driven solution designed to address the persistent challenge of customer churn in subscription-based industries. This model aims to identify customers at risk of churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures and implement targeted retention strategies.

## Process

-   Pull data from multiple sources, including remote sql server database

-   Develop the hypothesis and some analytical questions to answer

-   Data Preprocessing and cleaning & EDA(Univariate, Bivariate and multivariate Analysis)

-   Ansewring the analytical questions with visualizations

-   Deploying visualizations with PowerBI

-   Balancing the dataset with SMOTE algorithm for overfitting

-   Feature engineering and scaling

-   Model training and Evaluation

-   Hyperparameter Tuning

-   Prediction test and model improvements

-   Conclusion and article writing


## Conclusion and Recommendation

- Number of months the customer has stayed with the company (tenure) and the contract term of the customer (contract) are the most important features that have strong correlation with churn of the customer

- Vodafone should  enhance Early Customer Experience because in the first 5-10 months,  customer tenure shows a higher churn rate, suggesting that customer experience in the initial stages is vital. Focusing on improving onboarding processes, service quality, and addressing customer concerns during this crucial period with tech support can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

- Vodafone should Promote Long-Term Contracts, since the analysis indicates that customers with month-to-month contracts have a significantly higher churn rate compared to those with one-year or two-year contracts. Encouraging customers to opt for longer-term contracts through incentives, benefits, and increased tech support can potentially reduce churn rates and foster customer commitment.

- Hyperparameter tuning does not always drasitically improve model performance

- With 80/20 train/eval split, the random forest model achieved an accuracy of ~87%

- Gradient Boosting models perform well on classification tasks, compared to other regular ML models
